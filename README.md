# Change Wing Stage Number

Changes the Solus Wing interactable to spawn only on Stage 5, will not spawn on other stages. Goes straight to Solus Wing, DOES NOT go to conduit canyon. By default, the portal after Solus Heart takes you to the moon, can change in config to take you to the next stage (loop).
